## 1. North Star

mochi is the **first zero-footprint, Bun-native browser automation framework** designed to make programmatic web traffic mathematically and behaviorally indistinguishable from organic human traffic — purely from the JS layer, against stock Chromium-for-Testing.

It exists because the JS ecosystem has no single coherent answer for stealthy, reliable browser automation. Today you mix Patchright + a fingerprint injector + a Turnstile clicker + a residential proxy + custom CDP boilerplate + a Playwright state-machine wrapper, and the result is fragile, slow, leaky, and hard to reason about. mochi solves that problem once.

**Three philosophies, non-negotiable:**

1. **Relational Locking over Randomization.** Anti-bots catch the *Frankenstein fingerprint* — a Mac UA + Linux WebGL + Windows fonts. mochi locks every sub-system to a single device's manufacturing reality, derived from a `(profile, seed)` pair. Every probe surface is consistent with every other. No randomization, only deterministic relational derivation.
2. **Zero-Jitter over Proxying.** WAFs micro-time `performance.now()` deltas to catch execution overhead. mochi's spoofing must operate at native V8 speeds — synchronous JIT-optimized proxies, no async round-trips back to the Bun process when a WAF challenges. The injection happens once, before any page script runs, and is invisible thereafter.
3. **Behavioral Playback over Synthetic Paths.** Bots teleport in straight lines; humans overshoot, jitter, and correct. mochi's `humanClick`/`humanType`/`humanScroll` are derived from biomechanical models (Bezier + Fitts + Gaussian jitter) parameterized per profile, with a v1.x recording API to replay real captured traces.

**The funnel.** Some users will hit the JS-only ceiling — the things that genuinely require a Chromium patch (Runtime.enable detection, certain isolated-world boundaries, FPU/JIT divergence in cross-engine spoofing). The docs name these honestly. mochi does not point users anywhere; users find their own path. The framework's job is to be the best possible JS-layer answer.

---

## 2. Architectural invariants

These are not preferences. They are invariants. Any PR that violates one is wrong by definition.

**I-1. No C++ work in this repo.** Ever. No Chromium patches, no v8 patches, no native-code work that touches the browser binary. Everything mochi does is solvable from (a) JS injection, (b) Bun-native CDP control, or (c) the Rust FFI networking layer. When a problem genuinely requires a C++ patch, we document the limitation in `docs/limits.md` and move on.

**I-2. No proprietary integrations.** mochi never reaches for chaser, never branches on `MOCHI_USE_CHASER`, never carries env-var trapdoors that light up paid features. It is fully open-source, MIT-licensed, and equally useful to a solo developer with a laptop and to an enterprise with infrastructure.

**I-3. Bun-only runtime.** Engines = `bun >= 1.1`. Node is not a target. Deno is not a target. We use `Bun.spawn` (FDs 3+4 for pipe-mode CDP), `Bun.SQL`, `Bun.serve`, and Bun's file-descriptor APIs natively. The `package.json` engines field rejects non-Bun installs.

**I-4. Stock Chromium binary.** Default = pinned [Chromium-for-Testing](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/), auto-downloaded by `mochi browsers install`. BYO is supported via `binary: <path>`. We do **not** ship a patched fork.

**I-5. Relational consistency or nothing.** Every fingerprint surface mochi spoofs derives from a single `(profile, seed)` pair. No probe surface is ever set independently. If a user supplies an override, the override is logged as a *deliberate inconsistency* and the harness refuses to certify the profile.

**I-6. The Probe Manifest is the truth.** [Peekaboo's Probe Manifest schema](../Peekaboo/peekaboo/schemas/probe-manifest.schema.json) is the canonical surface description. mochi's harness produces and diffs Probe Manifests. If it's not in the manifest, it's not a tracked surface; if it's in the manifest and we don't cover it, that's a gap with an issue number.

**I-7. The harness is the gate.** Every PR that changes `@mochi.js/consistency`, `@mochi.js/inject`, `@mochi.js/core`, or `@mochi.js/profiles` runs the harness Zero-Diff gate against the affected profiles in CI. A PR that breaks Zero-Diff cannot merge without explicit waiver and a follow-up issue.

**I-8. Honesty over marketing.** `docs/limits.md` lists every fingerprint vector we know we don't cover, with a rationale. New gaps discovered must be added in the same PR that creates them.

## 3. Decisions ledger

Every locked decision, traceable to the brainstorm round that locked it. No decision in this table may be quietly reversed in a PR — if a decision needs to change, it's a discussion in a `discussion/<id>.md` doc that updates this table when concluded.

| # | Decision | Locked answer | Round |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Positioning | Standalone OSS, no proprietary integrations | R1 |
| 2 | Browser binary | Stock Chromium-for-Testing (BYO + autodownload) | R1 |
| 3 | Network impersonation | `Session.fetch` routes through Chromium itself via CDP (`Network.loadNetworkResource` + `page.evaluate("fetch")`); JA4 is real Chrome by definition. No parallel HTTP layer. | R1 + R3 |
| 4 | Engine spoofing scope (v1) | Chromium-family only (Chrome/Edge/Brave/Arc/Opera) | R1 |
| 5 | Runtime | Bun-only, ≥ 1.1 | R2 |
| 6 | Public API DX | Fresh — `mochi.launch / session.newPage / page.humanClick` | R2 |
| 7 | Repo structure | Bun-workspace monorepo, focused packages | R2 |
| 8 | Profile sourcing | Capture from real devices we own; hash-locked fixtures | R2 |
| 9 | C++ work | **Forbidden in this repo** | R1 (clarified) |
| 10 | Behavioral playback (v1) | Bezier + Fitts + jitter synthesis only; recording API in v1.x | R3 |
| 11 | Harness gate criteria | Probe Manifest diff against captured baselines; PR-fast smoke + nightly full | R3 |
| 12 | Dev harness shape | per-package contract tests + PR template + pre-push gate | R3 |
| 13 | License | MIT (entire repo, including Rust crate) | inferred from R1 |
| 14 | Versioning | Independent per-package semver via Changesets; `@mochi.js/core` is the public entry point (no umbrella package on npm) | inferred from R7 |
| 15 | Commit format | Conventional Commits with package scope (e.g. `feat(core): ...`) | R3 |

**Dataflow at runtime:**

1. `mochi.launch({ profile, seed })` → `@mochi.js/core` resolves the profile from `@mochi.js/profiles` and asks `@mochi.js/consistency` to derive the **Matrix** (the concrete relational fingerprint values for this seed).
2. `@mochi.js/inject` builds a payload (a single JS bundle, JIT-friendly, ~50KB target) parameterized by the Matrix.
3. `@mochi.js/core` spawns Chromium with `--remote-debugging-pipe` and a clean user-data-dir, attaches via Bun-native pipe FDs, and uses `Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument` with `runImmediately: true` to install the payload at top-of-frame on every navigation.
4. User calls `page.humanClick(sel)` → `@mochi.js/behavioral` synthesizes a path → `@mochi.js/core` issues `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` calls timed to the path.
5. User calls `session.fetch(url)` → `@mochi.js/core`'s `Session.fetch` picks Mechanism A (`Network.loadNetworkResource` for simple GETs) or Mechanism B (`page.evaluate("fetch")` against an `about:blank` scratch frame for non-GET) and routes through Chromium's network stack via CDP. JA4/JA3/H2 are real Chrome by definition.
6. CI runs `@mochi.js/harness` against the running session → captures a Probe Manifest → diffs against `@mochi.js/profiles/<profile>/baseline.manifest.json` → gate passes iff only GUID-class differences remain.

**Contracts between packages.**

Every cross-package contract lives in `packages/<pkg>/src/contract.ts` and is duplicated as a typed test in `tests/contract/<pkg>.contract.ts`. Contract tests run in CI for every PR. Breaking a contract requires bumping the consumer packages' major versions in the same PR (Changesets enforces).

---

## 5. Packages

Each package owns one well-bounded responsibility. The internal map below is binding — agents working on a task touch *one* primary package and may make small additive changes to its direct contract consumers, never a transitive fanout.

### 5.1 `@mochi.js/core`

**Responsibility.** Launch and lifecycle. CDP transport. Public Page/Session objects. The seam between Bun and Chromium.

**Owns.**
- `launch(opts)` → `Session`
- `Session` class: `newPage`, `pages`, `cookies`, `storage`, `close`
- `Page` class: `goto`, `content`, `text`, `evaluate`, `waitFor`, `humanClick`, `humanType`, `humanScroll`, `cookies`, `screenshot`
- CDP pipe transport (no TCP fallback)
- Bun.spawn-based Chromium process management
- User-data-dir lifecycle (always isolated per session, deleted on `close`)
- Graceful shutdown (SIGTERM, drain pending CDP messages, kill on timeout)

**Does not own.**
- Stealth payload generation (→ `@mochi.js/inject`)
- Fingerprint determinism (→ `@mochi.js/consistency`)
- Behavioral synthesis (→ `@mochi.js/behavioral`)
- Out-of-band HTTP (`Session.fetch` — Chromium-native via CDP; see §5.4)

**Critical design choices.**
- Pipe-mode default (`--remote-debugging-pipe`). No TCP port. WebSocket only as a future opt-in for remote debugging across machines (not v1).
- `Runtime.enable` is *globally forbidden* in this package. The CDP wrapper has a hard assertion that refuses to send `Runtime.enable`; tests verify it is never sent over the wire. Execution context tracking is done via `Page.frameAttached`/`Page.frameNavigated` + `uniqueContextId` resolution, never via `Runtime.executionContextCreated`.
- `Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument` with `runImmediately: true` is the sole injection mechanism. We do *not* use `Page.createIsolatedWorld` — it's detectable.
- Worker contexts (dedicated, shared, service, audio worklet) are picked up via `Target.setAutoAttach({ autoAttach: true, waitForDebuggerOnStart: true, flatten: true })` and the same payload is delivered to each.

### 5.2 `@mochi.js/consistency`

**Responsibility.** The Matrix engine. Generates an immutable, relationally-locked fingerprint snapshot from `(profile, seed)`.

**Owns.**
- `deriveMatrix(profile: ProfileV1, seed: string): MatrixV1`
- The relational locking ruleset (e.g. `gpu.vendor → webgl.unmaskedVendor → canvas.text-baseline → audio.contextSampleRate`)
- Per-profile entropy budget (a profile declares which fields are *fixed* by the device and which carry per-seed jitter)
- Seeded PRNG (deterministic; xoshiro256** with seed = sha256(profile.id + seed))

**Does not own.**
- The profile data itself (→ `@mochi.js/profiles`)
- Injection mechanics (→ `@mochi.js/inject`)
- Validation that the matrix matches reality (→ `@mochi.js/harness`)

**Critical design choices.**
- The Matrix is a *plain JSON-serializable object* with no functions. It can be passed across the FFI boundary, dumped to disk, diffed, and JSON-Schema validated.
- Relational rules are encoded as `Rule[]` with `inputs: string[]` and `output: string` referencing dotted paths into the Matrix. The DAG must be acyclic; CI verifies.
- A `MatrixV1` round-trips losslessly through JSON.

### 5.3 `@mochi.js/inject`

**Responsibility.** The Zero-Jitter payload. The single JS bundle that runs in every execution context to install the spoof proxies before any page script.

**Owns.**
- `buildPayload(matrix: MatrixV1): { code: string; sha256: string }`
- The proxy library (Object.defineProperty wrappers, `Function.prototype.toString` rewriting, error stack scrubbing, native-fn cloaking)
- Per-API spoof modules: `navigator`, `screen`, `webgl`, `webgpu`, `canvas`, `audio`, `media-devices`, `fonts`, `timing`, `permissions`, `client-hints`, `webrtc`, `battery`, `bot-globals`, `iframe-side-channel`
- Build-time concatenation + minification (esbuild) into a single TurboFan-friendly bundle

**Does not own.**
- The matrix values (→ `@mochi.js/consistency`)
- The CDP `addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument` call (→ `@mochi.js/core`)

**Critical design choices.**
- The payload is *one IIFE* delivered as a single string. No imports at runtime.
- Every override uses `Object.defineProperty` with `configurable: false` (so page code can't unwrap us by re-defining) and `enumerable` matching the original descriptor.
- Every spoofed function's `.toString()` returns the `function ${name}() { [native code] }` shape. We track the original `Function.prototype.toString` reference and use it to forward unknown queries.
- We never throw synchronously when a fingerprint API is called in an unexpected way — we mimic Chrome's exact native error type.
- The payload self-deletes its own initialization globals (`delete window.__mochi__`) before yielding to page script.

### 5.4 `Session.fetch` (Chromium-native)

**Responsibility.** Out-of-band HTTP that shares the browser's apparent identity. Pre-0.7 this was a Rust+wreq layer behind a `@mochi.js/net` / `@mochi.js/net-rs` package pair; post-0.7 it's a CDP-driven path baked into `@mochi.js/core`. The two npm packages are deprecated.

**How it works.** `Session.fetch(url, init?)` picks one of two CDP paths based on the call shape:

- **Mechanism A — `Network.loadNetworkResource`.** Used for simple GETs (no `init` / no method override / no headers / no body). Bypasses CORS at the network layer; no `Origin` header. Body returns as an `IO.StreamHandle` drained via `IO.read` until EOF, then `IO.close`. Requires a `frameId` — the Session lazily allocates an `about:blank` scratch frame for this.
- **Mechanism B — `page.evaluate("fetch(url, init)")` against the scratch frame's document.** Used for everything else. Cookies inherit from the page's origin; CORS applies the same as a real user's `fetch` from the console. Body shapes supported: `string`, `ArrayBuffer` / typed arrays, `URLSearchParams`. `Blob` / `FormData` / `ReadableStream` throw with a clear diagnostic.

Both paths route through Chromium's network stack — same TLS / H2 / JA4 as `page.goto`. Because Chromium IS the client, JA4/JA3/H2 are real Chrome by definition. The proxy egress (`--proxy-server`) is shared with the browser navigation; no per-call proxy URL.

**Does not own.**
- Spoofing the *browser's own* TLS (out of scope — that's the binary's responsibility, and stock Chromium produces correct Chrome TLS already).
- `Blob` / `FormData` / `ReadableStream` request bodies (deferred to a future PR; needs a richer transport than the JSON-only page-evaluate seam).

**Critical design choices.**
- No native code, no FFI, no cdylib to install or trust. Any host that runs Chromium-for-Testing runs `Session.fetch`.
- The contract test `tests/contract/session-fetch-no-network-enable.contract.test.ts` empirically pins that `Network.loadNetworkResource` does NOT require `Network.enable` (which would be forbidden under §8.2). If Chromium ever changes that, the test fails loudly and the recovery is to drop Mechanism A and route everything via Mechanism B.
- Cookies inherit from the session's cookie jar — a breaking change vs. the wreq path (cookieless). Documented in CHANGELOG and `reference/migration.md`.

### 5.5 `@mochi.js/behavioral`

**Responsibility.** Synthesize human-shaped input event streams from biomechanical models, parameterized per profile.

**Owns.**
- `synthesizeMouseTrajectory(from, to, profile): TrajectoryEvent[]`
- `synthesizeKeystrokes(text, profile): KeystrokeEvent[]`
- `synthesizeScroll(target, profile): ScrollEvent[]`
- The Bezier path generator (cubic, with overshoot+correction)
- Fitts's Law duration model (`MT = a + b * log2(D/W + 1)`, parameterized per profile)
- Gaussian jitter (per-axis, with autocorrelation)
- Keystroke ngraph timing (digraph means ~80–150ms per profile, with per-letter variance)

**Does not own.**
- Dispatching events to CDP (→ `@mochi.js/core`)
- The profile data (→ `@mochi.js/profiles`)

**Critical design choices.**
- Outputs are pure data (`{ tMs, type, x, y, ... }[]`) — no side effects. `@mochi.js/core` consumes the array and dispatches via `Input.dispatchMouseEvent`/`Input.dispatchKeyEvent`.
- v1 is synthesis-only. The recording/playback API is v1.x; the contract leaves room for it (`humanClick` will accept a `trace?: RecordedTrace` parameter from v1.x onward without breaking).
- Profiles declare a `behavior` block: `{ hand: "right", tremor: 0.18, wpm: 65, scrollStyle: "smooth" }`. Defaults exist; users can override per-call.

### 5.6 `@mochi.js/profiles`

**Responsibility.** The data fixtures. Each profile is a directory under `packages/profiles/data/<profile-id>/` with three files:

```
<profile-id>/
├── profile.json         # ProfileV1 — the spec the consistency engine consumes
├── baseline.manifest.json  # ProbeManifestV1 captured from the real device
└── PROVENANCE.md        # Who captured, when, on what hardware, with what tool versions
```

**v1 catalog:**

| profile.id | Hardware | OS | Browser | Engine |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mac-m2-chrome-stable` | Mac M2 Air | macOS 14.x | Chrome stable | V8 (Chromium) |
| `mac-m1-chrome-stable` | Mac M1 | macOS 14.x | Chrome stable | V8 |
| `mac-intel-chrome-stable` | Mac Intel | macOS 13.x | Chrome stable | V8 |
| `win11-chrome-stable` | Win 11 x64 | 11 23H2 | Chrome stable | V8 |
| `win11-edge-stable` | Win 11 x64 | 11 23H2 | Edge stable | V8 (Chromium) |
| `linux-chrome-stable` | Generic x86_64 | Ubuntu 22.04 | Chrome stable | V8 |

**Shipping rule.** A profile cannot land in `main` without:
1. A `profile.json` validated against `schemas/profile.schema.json`.
2. A `baseline.manifest.json` captured by `mochi capture` on real hardware (provenance documented).
3. A `PROVENANCE.md` with: capturer, date, machine model + serial-suffix-only, browser version, mochi version, capture command.
4. Harness Zero-Diff against itself (the captured baseline replayed against the framework using the same profile must produce a manifest that diffs only on GUID-class fields).

### 5.7 `@mochi.js/harness`

**Responsibility.** Validation. Captures Probe Manifests from a Mochi-driven session, normalizes, diffs against committed baselines, classifies divergences, gates PRs.

**Owns.**
- `capture(session): Promise<ProbeManifestV1>` — drives a session through the standard probe page set
- `normalize(m: ProbeManifestV1): NormalizedManifest` — strips per-session entropy
- `diff(a: NormalizedManifest, b: NormalizedManifest): DiffEntry[]`
- `categorize(d: DiffEntry): "guid-class" | "intentional" | "material"` — mirrors Peekaboo's pattern
- `report(diff: DiffEntry[]): { verdict, structuralMatchPct, html, json }`

**Probe page set (v1).**
1. local fixture: `tests/fixtures/probe-page.html` — a deterministic synthesis of every probe in `chaser-recon/src/lib/fingerprint/*` (audio, canvas, webgl, webgpu, navigator, screen, fonts, storage, media, speech, timing, bot-detection)
2. `https://abrahamjuliot.github.io/creepjs/` (online; gated behind `--include-online`)
3. `https://bot.sannysoft.com/` (online; gated)
4. `https://browserleaks.com/` family (online; gated)
5. `https://kaliiiiiiiiii.github.io/brotector/` (online; gated)

The local fixture is the PR-fast gate. The online suite runs nightly.

**Verdict rule.** `EQUIVALENT (0 material diffs)` or `DIVERGED (N material, M intentional, K guid-class)`. PR gate fails iff `material > 0`. Categorization rules:
- **guid-class.** Both sides carry a per-session value (visitor IDs, install IDs, MUID-class GUIDs). Allowlisted by regex.
- **intentional.** Anything explicitly listed in `@mochi.js/profiles/<id>/expected-divergences.json` (e.g., probes that the profile explicitly cannot replicate from JS-only — the `docs/limits.md` set).
- **material.** Everything else. PR-blocking.

### 5.8 `@mochi.js/cli`

**Responsibility.** The `mochi` command-line. Provides:

- `mochi browsers install [--channel stable|beta] [--version X]` — fetches Chromium-for-Testing
- `mochi capture --profile <id> --out <dir>` — captures a baseline from the local device
- `mochi harness <profile> [--against <baseline>]` — runs the harness manually
- `mochi work create|list|open|submit|clean` — the worktree dev harness CLI (Section 15)
- `mochi version` — version info, including bundled Chromium version

### 5.9 No umbrella package — `@mochi.js/core` is the primary entry

mochi does not publish a top-level umbrella package. The bare `mochi` and the bare `@mochi` scope are both taken on npm by unrelated parties. We own the `@mochi.js` scope (with the dot — same shape as the precedented `@socket.io/*`), and every package in the catalog lives there. The public-facing entry point is **`@mochi.js/core`**. One coherent naming story, no umbrella to keep in sync.

```sh
bun add @mochi.js/core
```
```ts
import { mochi } from "@mochi.js/core";
const session = await mochi.launch({ profile, seed });
```

Power users can pull internal packages directly:

```sh
bun add @mochi.js/profiles @mochi.js/behavioral @mochi.js/harness
```

The brand name is **mochi** in all narrative contexts (headlines, prose, error messages, docs). The `.js` suffix appears only where it's a literal identifier — the npm scope `@mochi.js/*`. The GitHub repo (`github.com/0xchasercat/mochi`), the JS namespace in user code (`mochi.launch`), and every doc heading drop the suffix.

## 6. Data schemas

All schemas live in `schemas/*.schema.json` (JSON Schema 2020-12). TS types are *generated* from the schemas by `bun run codegen` — never written by hand. CI verifies that committed types match the schemas.

### 6.1 `ProfileV1`

```

`entropyBudget.fixed` fields are constants for this profile across all seeds. `entropyBudget.perSeed` fields are deterministic-but-vary-per-seed within bounds the profile declares (e.g., `display.width` is one of `[2560, 1920, 1440]` chosen by `seed % 3`).

### 6.2 `MatrixV1`

The Matrix is a profile *instantiated for a specific seed*. Same shape as `ProfileV1` but with all `perSeed` fields resolved to concrete values. Adds:
- `seed: string` — the input seed
- `derivedAt: string` — ISO timestamp
- `consistencyEngineVersion: string`

### 6.3 `ProbeManifestV1`

Reuse [Peekaboo's schema](../Peekaboo/peekaboo/schemas/probe-manifest.schema.json) verbatim. Copy the file to `schemas/probe-manifest.schema.json` at v0.0 to vendor it; track upstream changes manually with a quarterly sync. (We don't take a git submodule on Peekaboo because Peekaboo is private and mochi is public.)

### 6.4 `DiffReportV1`

## 7. Public API

The complete v1 surface. Every signature here is part of the contract; changes require a major version bump on `@mochi.js/core`.

```typescript
// @mochi.js/core (the primary public entry — no umbrella package)
// Users: import { mochi, type LaunchOptions } from "@mochi.js/core";
// Power users wanting types from internals: import type { ProfileV1, MatrixV1 } from "@mochi.js/consistency";

export const mochi: {
  launch(opts: LaunchOptions): Promise<Session>;
};

export interface LaunchOptions {
  profile: ProfileId | ProfileV1;        // string id (resolved against @mochi.js/profiles) or inline profile
  seed: string;                          // deterministic per-session entropy seed
  proxy?: string | ProxyConfig;
  headless?: boolean;                    // default: false
  binary?: string;                       // override Chromium path
  args?: string[];                       // additional Chromium flags
  out?: { traceDir?: string };           // optional CDP trace dump for debugging
  timeout?: number;                      // ms, default 30_000
}

export class Session {
  readonly profile: MatrixV1;            // resolved matrix for this session
  readonly seed: string;
  newPage(): Promise<Page>;
  pages(): Page[];
  cookies(filter?: { url?: string }): Promise<Cookie[]>;
  setCookies(cookies: Cookie[]): Promise<void>;
  storage(): Promise<StorageSnapshot>;
  fetch(url: string, init?: RequestInit): Promise<Response>;  // out-of-band, profile-fingerprinted
  close(): Promise<void>;
}

export class Page {
  readonly url: string;
  goto(url: string, opts?: { waitUntil?: "load" | "domcontentloaded" | "networkidle"; timeout?: number }): Promise<void>;
  content(): Promise<string>;
  text(selector: string): Promise<string | null>;
  evaluate<T>(fn: () => T): Promise<T>;  // runs in main world; isolation is implicit & invisible
  waitFor(selector: string, opts?: { timeout?: number; state?: "attached" | "visible" | "hidden" }): Promise<void>;

  humanClick(selector: string, opts?: { button?: "left" | "right" | "middle"; duration?: number }): Promise<void>;
  humanType(selector: string, text: string, opts?: { wpm?: number; mistakeRate?: number }): Promise<void>;
  humanScroll(opts: { to: string | { x: number; y: number }; duration?: number }): Promise<void>;

  cookies(): Promise<Cookie[]>;
  screenshot(opts?: { fullPage?: boolean; path?: string }): Promise<Uint8Array>;
  close(): Promise<void>;
}
```

Design notes:
- `evaluate` runs in main world, but the spoof payload guarantees observed page-API state matches the spoof. There is no exposed isolated-world concept; that's an implementation detail.
- `humanClick` resolves the selector, computes a viewport-relative target box, picks a target point inside the box (Gaussian-distributed toward center), and drives the mouse from current cursor position to that point via the synthesized trajectory.
- `Session.fetch` is the *only* way to get profile-fingerprinted out-of-band requests. It returns a standard Web `Response` so users can `await res.json()` etc.
- No `Browser`/`BrowserContext`/`Page` triad. `Session` *is* the per-(profile,seed) lifecycle. Multiple `Session`s = multiple Chromium processes.

## 8. CDP engine design notes

The CDP engine is the most stealth-sensitive component. Get this wrong and nothing else matters.

### 8.1 Transport

- **Default = pipe mode** (`--remote-debugging-pipe`). Three FDs: stdin, stdout, and pipe FDs 3+4. mochi passes pipes to the child via `Bun.spawn({ stdio: [..., "pipe", "pipe"] })` and reads/writes newline-delimited JSON-RPC.
- **No TCP fallback in v1.** Remote-debugging-over-TCP creates a localhost listener that's discoverable by side-channel attacks (`chrome://inspect`, port scans, etc). v2 may add an opt-in `transport: "ws"` for cross-machine debugging.
- **No DevTools Protocol session sharing.** Each `Session` gets its own pipe. Two `Session`s never share a Chromium process.

### 8.2 What we do NOT send

This is a hard list. The CDP wrapper has runtime asserts that refuse these:
- `Runtime.enable` (any target). Detectable by `error.stack` lookup tricks. nodriver's whole insight.
- `Page.createIsolatedWorld`. Also detectable.
- `Runtime.evaluate` with `includeCommandLineAPI: true` (leaks `$x`, `$_`, etc.).
- `Network.enable` *globally* on the root target — only attached per-frame when needed for a specific operation, then disabled.

**Note on `Fetch.enable`** (task 0266): `Fetch.enable` is NOT on the
forbidden list. It operates at the network layer below page script — no
execution-context-creation events surface, no `chrome.devtools` global is
exposed, and JS cannot detect its presence directly. mochi sends it once
per session (gated only on `bypassInject`) so the §8.4 init-script
delivery pivot can intercept document responses for body splice + CSP
rewrite. The cost is one CDP RTT per Document request and a no-op
forward (`Fetch.continueRequest`) on every other request type.

### 8.3 How we get execution-context info without `Runtime.enable`

- Subscribe to `Page.frameAttached` and `Page.frameNavigated` to learn frame topology.
- Resolve frame → execution-context via `DOM.resolveNode({ backendNodeId: documentNode })` which returns a `RemoteObject` carrying a usable `objectId`. From `objectId` we can `Runtime.callFunctionOn` without ever calling `Runtime.enable`.
- For workers/service-workers/audio-worklets: `Target.setAutoAttach({ autoAttach: true, waitForDebuggerOnStart: true, flatten: true })`. Each new sub-target gets its own session. We do *not* aggregate worker contexts under the page session.

### 8.4 Payload injection

**Amended by task 0266** — the inject delivery mechanism has been rotated
from `Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument` to a `Fetch.fulfillRequest`
body splice + CSP rewriter, mirroring patchright's
`crNetworkManagerPatch.ts:166-453` (`RouteImpl._fixCSP`,
`_injectIntoHead`, `fulfill`).

#### Mechanism (current)

- One `Fetch.enable` per session (gated only on `bypassInject` — capture
  flows skip), with patterns
  `[{ urlPattern: "*", resourceType: "Document" }, { urlPattern: "*" }]`
  and `handleAuthRequests: true` when proxy creds are configured.
- On `Fetch.requestPaused` for a `Document`:
  1. Request stage → `Fetch.continueRequest` with
     `interceptResponse: true` (so we get the response too).
  2. Response stage → `Fetch.getResponseBody`, rewrite CSP in BOTH
     response headers (`Content-Security-Policy`,
     `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`) AND inline
     `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy">` tags, splice the
     payload as `<script class="__mochi_init_script__" id="…">…</script>`
     at end-of-`<head>` BEFORE the first non-comment `<script>`,
     `Fetch.fulfillRequest` with the rewritten body.
- On `Fetch.requestPaused` for non-Document → `Fetch.continueRequest`
  immediately (zero-cost pass-through; the request hangs if we don't
  reply).
- The injected `<script>` carries NO `defer`, `async`, or
  `type="module"` — those defer execution past first parse and
  re-introduce the race window the original `runImmediately:true` was
  designed to close.
- The payload IIFE's first statement is
  `document.currentScript?.remove()`; a post-`load` DOM walk strips any
  leftover `.__mochi_init_script__` nodes (defence in depth).
- See `packages/core/src/cdp/init-injector.ts` for the implementation.

#### CSP rewriter contract

| Input policy                                         | Action                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `script-src 'self'`                                  | Append `'unsafe-inline'`                                       |
| `script-src 'nonce-XYZ'`                             | Reuse `XYZ` as the injected tag's `nonce` attribute            |
| `script-src 'strict-dynamic' 'nonce-XYZ'`            | Reuse `XYZ`; `'strict-dynamic'` admits transitive scripts      |
| `script-src 'strict-dynamic'` (no nonce — invalid)   | Fall through to `'unsafe-inline'` (best-effort)                |
| `default-src 'self'` (no script-src)                 | Append `'unsafe-inline'` to `default-src`                      |
| `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="…">` | Same rules; rewrite the `content` attribute in-place      |
| Multiple CSPs (header + meta)                        | Most-restrictive wins; rewrite EVERY policy independently      |

#### Rationale

`Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument` carries a source-attribution
leak — the "Vanilla CDP" detection probe inspects how the very first
script entered the page and recognises the
`addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument` channel. The new mechanism is
byte-indistinguishable from a same-origin developer's own `<script>`
tag at the top of `<head>`.

#### Trade-offs

- `Fetch.enable` becomes always-on (gated only on `bypassInject`).
  Cost: one CDP RTT per Document request for the body fetch +
  fulfillment, one no-op forward per non-Document request. Both are
  bounded and only active when inject delivery is active.
- The patchright README admits the new path is detectable by *timing*
  attacks (the body splice introduces a measurable latency on the
  document request). No production antibot exploits this today — the
  trade is favourable. This is documented under `docs/limits.md`.
- `data:` and `about:blank` URLs are NOT intercepted by the Fetch
  domain; inject delivery on those URLs is intentionally a no-op (out
  of scope, behaviour preserved from the §8.4 baseline).

#### Workers (unchanged from previous §8.4)

For workers we set up an `AddScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument`-equivalent
using `Target.setAutoAttach` + on-attach `Runtime.evaluate` (the worker
target accepts evaluate; the main page target does not have
`Runtime.enable` issued). The idOnly bootstrap (task 0254) refines the
pattern to `Runtime.evaluate("globalThis", { serialization: "idOnly" })`
+ `Runtime.callFunctionOn` against the parsed contextId.

### 8.5 Process management

- Chromium spawned with a fresh, ephemeral user-data-dir (`mkdtemp("mochi-")`).
- Hard kill on `Session.close`: SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after 2s grace, then `rm -rf` the user-data-dir.
- Crash recovery: if the child exits unexpectedly, all open `Page`s reject pending promises with a `BrowserCrashedError`. Sessions do not auto-restart.

### 8.6 Flags we always pass

Two-tier flag set as of task 0256 (audit against patchright
`chromiumSwitchesPatch.ts:20-34` + `puppeteer-real-browser`
`lib/cjs/index.js:57-58`):

#### Production default — `LaunchOptions.hermetic: false` (default)

```
--remote-debugging-pipe
--user-data-dir=<tmpdir>
--no-default-browser-check
--no-first-run
--no-service-autorun
--password-store=basic
--use-mock-keychain
--disable-features=Translate,AcceptCHFrame,IsolateOrigins,site-per-process
--enable-features=NetworkService,NetworkServiceInProcess
```

Plus `--headless=new` (when `headless: true`), `--proxy-server=<…>` (when
`proxy` is set), `--lang=<…>` (matrix locale; task 0251),
`--window-size=<W>,<H>` (matrix display; task 0252). User-supplied
`LaunchOptions.args` and the `MOCHI_EXTRA_ARGS` env passthrough append last
(after `--start-maximized` is scrubbed per task 0252).

#### Hermetic addendum — `LaunchOptions.hermetic: true`

The harness, CI, and `mochi capture` flows append these on top of the
production set:

```
--disable-default-apps
--disable-component-update
--disable-background-networking
--disable-sync
--disable-features=OptimizationHints,MediaRouter,InterestFeedContentSuggestions,CalculateNativeWinOcclusion
```

Chromium merges multiple `--disable-features=` tokens into a union, so the
final hermetic disabled set is `{Translate, AcceptCHFrame, IsolateOrigins,
site-per-process, OptimizationHints, MediaRouter,
InterestFeedContentSuggestions, CalculateNativeWinOcclusion}`.

#### Decision lineage (task 0256 audit)

| Flag                                      | Production | Hermetic | Why                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--remote-debugging-pipe`                 | ✅         | ✅       | §8.2 pipe-mode CDP transport — non-negotiable.                                 |
| `--no-default-browser-check`              | ✅         | ✅       | Suppresses "set as default" nag; not a tell (Playwright keeps it).             |
| `--no-first-run`                          | ✅         | ✅       | Suppresses welcome screen in headed mode.                                      |
| `--no-service-autorun`                    | ✅         | ✅       | Suppresses Win bg services; not a tell.                                        |
| `--password-store=basic`                  | ✅         | ✅       | Prevents Linux keyring popup; matches stable Chrome behaviour.                 |
| `--use-mock-keychain`                     | ✅         | ✅       | macOS keychain stub; not a tell.                                               |
| `--disable-features=Translate,AcceptCHFrame,IsolateOrigins,site-per-process` | ✅ | ✅ | Load-bearing: `IsolateOrigins,site-per-process` keeps OOPIF frames in-process for inject reach; `AcceptCHFrame` keeps UA-CH off the frame-negotiation path so our `Sec-CH-UA` (R-007) is the single source of truth; `Translate` suppresses the headed translate prompt. |
| `--enable-features=NetworkService,NetworkServiceInProcess` | ✅ | ✅ | Keeps NetworkService in the renderer process so CDP `Network.*` / `Fetch.*` can intercept everything. |
| `--disable-default-apps`                  | ❌         | ✅       | **Patchright drops** as cmdline tell. Production gets normal default-apps behaviour; hermetic suppresses. |
| `--disable-component-update`              | ❌         | ✅       | **Patchright drops; PRB drops.** Cmdline tell. Hermetic suppresses for harness determinism. |
| `--disable-background-networking`         | ❌         | ✅       | **Patchright drops.** Updater traffic suppressor; production users want normal-looking traffic. |
| `--disable-sync`                          | ❌         | ✅       | **Patchright drops.** Cmdline tell; harmless to leave on for production (Chromium-for-Testing has no Google account). |
| `--disable-features=OptimizationHints,MediaRouter,InterestFeedContentSuggestions,CalculateNativeWinOcclusion` | ❌ | ✅ | Network/noise suppression for hermetic determinism only; production users want the natural network surface. |

**Explicit non-defaults (per audit):**
- `--no-sandbox`: real-user fingerprint leak. CI uses `MOCHI_EXTRA_ARGS=--no-sandbox` env passthrough only.
- `--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled`: patchright adds this back to its flag set; mochi rejects — we patch `navigator.webdriver` from JS via R-022. Adds a flag-level tell at `chrome://version` for marginal benefit.
- `--enable-unsafe-swiftshader`: NOT emitted (verified). Patchright strips Playwright's headless SwiftShader fallback that produces a distinct GL fingerprint; mochi never had it.
- `--start-maximized`: actively scrubbed from `LaunchOptions.args` and `MOCHI_EXTRA_ARGS` (task 0252).
- Legacy `--headless` (without `=new`): NOT emitted (verified). The `=new` form is critical — sannysoft trivially detects legacy headless.

## 9. Consistency engine design notes

### 9.1 The Matrix concept

A `ProfileV1` declares the *capabilities* of a device class; a `MatrixV1` is the concrete instantiation for one `(profile, seed)` pair. The Matrix is what the injector consumes. Two distinct seeds produce two distinct Matrices, but each Matrix is internally fully consistent.

### 9.2 The relational locking ruleset

Encoded as a DAG of rules. Each rule reads inputs and produces a deterministic output. The DAG must be acyclic (CI-checked).

Examples:
- `R-001` `[gpu.vendor, gpu.renderer]` → `webgl.unmaskedVendor`
- `R-002` `[gpu.vendor, gpu.renderer]` → `webgl.unmaskedRenderer`
- `R-003` `[gpu.renderer]` → `canvas.font-rendering-baseline-hash` (lookup table)
- `R-004` `[device.cpuFamily]` → `audio.contextSampleRate`
- `R-005` `[device.cpuFamily, audio.contextSampleRate]` → `audio.fingerprint-bytes` (precomputed)
- `R-006` `[os.name, browser.name]` → `userAgent` (plus seed-driven build number variance)
- `R-007` `[os.name, browser.name, browser.version]` → `uaCh.sec-ch-ua`
- `R-008` `[device.memoryGB]` → `navigator.deviceMemory` (cap at 8 per chaser-browser observation; 8GB is the max value Chrome reports)
- `R-009` `[device.cores]` → `navigator.hardwareConcurrency`
- `R-010` `[os.name]` → `fonts.list` (curated from real captures)
- ... (full ruleset checked into `packages/consistency/rules/*.ts`, ~80 rules at v1.0)

### 9.3 Audio consistency

Audio fingerprinting (OfflineAudioContext rendering output) is one of the trickiest areas. The fingerprint is a sequence of float samples produced by hardware-specific FFT/IIR processing. We cannot compute these from primitives — we consume per-profile captures from `packages/profiles/data/<id>/baseline.manifest.json`'s `audio` block (the `audioHash` + `sampleValues` window the v0.7 probe corpus measures).

The lock chain is implemented as **R-047** (`audioFingerprint`): inputs `(id, audio.contextSampleRate)`, output `uaCh.audio-fingerprint` JSON `{ sampleRate, audioHash, sampleValues[10] }`. The lookup table lives in `packages/consistency/src/rules/lookups/audio-canvas.ts`.

The inject module `packages/inject/src/modules/audio-fingerprint.ts` patches `OfflineAudioContext.prototype.startRendering`. The wrapper runs the underlying call (preserving real-startRendering timing — synthetic 0ms is a tell), then **overlays** the captured `sampleValues` onto channel 0 at indices [4500..4510) and balances the remaining [4510..4999) range so `sum |data[i]|` over [4500..5000) equals the captured `audioHash` byte-exactly. Indices outside the [4500..5000) probe window stay native-rendered.

Caveat: a fingerprinter that samples *outside* this window sees real CfT-rendered audio (mismatch vs the device baseline). No public probe in the v0.7 corpus does this; v0.8 may extend the captured window if the corpus changes. Documented as a known divergence in `docs/limits.md`. Task 0267.

### 9.4 Canvas consistency

Canvas text rendering produces hashes that depend on font rendering pipeline + GPU + OS subpixel hinting. The captured baselines record only the probe-side observables — `hash` (the probe's `hashString` of the full data URL), `dataUrlLength`, `dataUrlPrefix` (first 50 chars), and JPEG/WebP length echoes. We don't have the full PNG bytes; the inject layer **synthesises** a data URL whose probe-side observable triple matches byte-exactly.

The lock chain is implemented as **R-048** (`canvasFingerprint`): input `(id,)`, output `uaCh.canvas-fingerprint` JSON `{ consistent, hash, dataUrlLength, dataUrlPrefix, webpSupport, jpegHighLength, jpegLowLength }`. Same lookup table as R-047.

The inject module `packages/inject/src/modules/canvas-fingerprint.ts` patches `HTMLCanvasElement.prototype.toDataURL`, `OffscreenCanvas.prototype.convertToBlob`, and the 2D context's draw methods (to flag "this canvas had drawing"). The data URL synthesis uses **meet-in-the-middle search** over the trailing 8 base64 characters: build a body of length `targetLen - 8`, compute its hash, then iterate (c0..c3) and look up the residual in a precomputed map of all 4-char tail contributions. Build cost is one-time ~150ms per profile.

The "is this a fingerprint probe?" heuristic gates the spoof on three conditions:

  1. Canvas size matches a known probe size: 300×150 (chaser-recon, creepjs, fingerprintjs default), 240×140 (bot.incolumitas), 200×60 (Akamai bot-mgmt), 280×60 (Cloudflare challenge).
  2. The canvas has recorded drawing commands (a 2D-context method-tap WeakMap).
  3. At least one text draw (`fillText` / `strokeText`) has happened.

When all three pass, `toDataURL` returns the synthetic data URL. When any fails, the call falls through to native rendering — so legitimate canvas use (game framebuffers, image filters, signature pads) keeps working. Manual review of 1000 top-Alexa pages put the FP rate <1%; the 300×150 default size is the dominant source (legitimate text-on-default-canvas). Mitigation: those pages still see the captured-derived bytes (which look like real Chrome to fingerprinters); only the decoded *image* is broken, which matters only to the rare debug-overlay path. Task 0267.

WebGL pixel-byte replay is out of v0.2 scope — separate surface, R-001/R-002 already lock the WebGL renderer/vendor strings; pixel-byte replay is a deeper investigation tracked in v0.8+.

### 9.5 What we cover in v1

The 13 probe families from `chaser-recon/src/lib/fingerprint/*`:
- ✅ navigator (UA, plugins, permissions, client-hints, hardware info)
- ✅ screen (dims, DPR, CSS media queries, visual viewport)
- ✅ canvas (2D rendering hash via precomputed-table-or-noise hybrid)
- ✅ webgl + webgpu (parameters, render hash, shader precision)
- ✅ audio (OfflineAudioContext output via precomputed bytes)
- ✅ media-devices (enumerate with persistent IDs)
- ✅ speech-synthesis (voice list per OS profile)
- ✅ fonts (curated installed-font list per OS profile)
- ✅ storage (localStorage, sessionStorage, cookies, IndexedDB, service workers — passthrough; no spoofing needed)
- ✅ bot-detection (`navigator.webdriver`, automation key globals removed, plugin count consistent, etc.)
- ⚠️ timing (timezone, locale, performance-now precision — we *match* Chrome's natural behavior; we don't spoof against Chrome's true clock for same-engine v1)
- ✅ FPJS Pro (the public visitor-id outputs match the device baseline because the underlying probes match)

### 9.6 Cross-layer consistency: exit IP ↔ timezone ↔ locale (task 0262)

The `(matrix.timezone, matrix.locale)` axis is special: it's the only matrix-derived value whose canonical "consistent" value depends on a state OUTSIDE the matrix itself — namely, the **apparent exit IP** as seen by any server the session contacts. A US-West profile (matrix.timezone = `America/Los_Angeles`, matrix.locale = `en-US`) routed through an EU-egressing residential proxy puts every page call to `Date.getTimezoneOffset()` at -480min while the IP geolocates to UTC+1 — a direct mismatch fingerprint.

Mochi closes this leak at launch via a 7-endpoint geo-probe (`packages/core/src/geo-probe.ts`) routed through Chromium's network stack via CDP (so the probe is itself indistinguishable from real session traffic — it IS real session traffic). The probe is shuffled-sequential with a 4-attempt cap and 2s per-endpoint timeout; on all-fail it returns `null`. A reconciler (`packages/core/src/geo-consistency.ts`) cross-references the matrix tz/locale against the probed IP geolocation, applying one of four `LaunchOptions.geoConsistency` modes:

- `"privacy-fallback"` *(default)* — override the matrix to UTC + en-US on mismatch (or probe failure). Fingerprints as a privacy-conscious user (Tor / Brave / hardened-FF), which is benign in most threat models. Mismatched-tz-vs-IP is the canonical bot signature; UTC + en-US looks like every Tor user.
- `"auto-correct"` — override the matrix's timezone with the IP's timezone and locale with a primary-locale guess for the IP's country. Trusts mochi's IP-derived defaults over the user's declared profile.
- `"strict"` — throw `GeoMismatchError` on mismatch. Probe failure does NOT throw (network blip, not a mismatch).
- `"off"` — skip the probe entirely. Used in offline tests / when the probe service is rate-limited.

Mismatch criteria use **timezone offset minutes** (computed via `Intl.DateTimeFormat({timeZoneName: "longOffset"}).formatToParts`), not zone names — `America/New_York` and `America/Detroit` share an offset and fingerprint identically. Locale region comes from `Intl.Locale(matrix.locale).region`.

The JS-side timezone spoof is delivered per-target via CDP `Emulation.setTimezoneOverride`, which drives both `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone` AND `Date.getTimezoneOffset()` because Chromium's V8 reads from the same internal source. The override does NOT require `Emulation.enable`, so §8.2's bans are unaffected. Mochi NEVER manually rewrites `Date.prototype.getTimezoneOffset` — that's detectable via prototype-shape checks.

Probe results are NOT cached across sessions — proxy IPs rotate; stale cache is worse than no cache.

### 9.7 What we don't cover (documented in `docs/limits.md`)

- WebRTC IP leak (depends on system network config; v1 tells users to use a proxy that handles this themselves)
- Battery API removed in modern Chrome (no spoofing needed)
- Trust Tokens / Topics / FedCM (v1: passthrough, document as known surface)
- Sensor APIs (`DeviceOrientation`, etc.) on desktop profiles — not exposed by Chrome on desktop, no need to spoof

## 10. `Session.fetch` design notes (Chromium-native)

`Session.fetch(url, init?)` lives in `@mochi.js/core`. It picks one of two CDP paths based on the call shape:

- **Mechanism A — `Network.loadNetworkResource`.** Used for simple GETs (no `init` / no method override / no headers / no body). The CDP method runs against the host's StoragePartition rather than the per-target `NetworkAgent`, so it does NOT require `Network.enable` (which is forbidden under §8.2). Body returns as an `IO.StreamHandle` drained via `IO.read` until EOF and then `IO.close`d. Requires a `frameId` — the Session lazily allocates an `about:blank` scratch frame for this.
- **Mechanism B — `page.evaluate("fetch(url, init)")` against the scratch frame's document.** Used for everything else. The function source is bound via `Runtime.callFunctionOn` against the document's `objectId` — no `Runtime.enable`, no isolated worlds. Cookies inherit from the page's origin (the scratch frame is `about:blank`, but the cookie jar is shared via `Storage.setCookies`). CORS applies the same as a real user's `fetch`. Body shapes: `string`, `ArrayBuffer` / typed arrays, `URLSearchParams`. `Blob` / `FormData` / `ReadableStream` throw with a clear diagnostic.

Both mechanisms route through Chromium's network stack, so the bytes a server observes on `Session.fetch` are byte-identical to what Chromium emits on `page.goto` to the same origin.

### What we don't try to do

- We do NOT MITM the browser's own connections. Browsing traffic uses Chromium's native TLS — `Session.fetch` rides the same stack via CDP rather than spinning up a parallel HTTP layer.
- We do NOT ship a Rust HTTP-impersonation crate (the pre-0.7 `@mochi.js/net-rs` package is deprecated). The whole "JA4 spoof" idea is moot when Chromium IS the client.
- We do NOT implement a separate page navigator. The browser is the browser.

### Verification

`tests/contract/session-fetch-no-network-enable.contract.test.ts` empirically pins that `Network.loadNetworkResource` does NOT require `Network.enable`. If Chromium ever changes that, the test fails loudly; recovery is to drop Mechanism A and route everything via Mechanism B.

## 11. Behavioral engine design notes

### 11.1 Mouse trajectory model

Cubic Bezier with 4 control points:
- P0 = current cursor position
- P3 = target point (sampled inside target box, Gaussian toward center)
- P1, P2 = control points placed off-axis, magnitude ~ 0.3–0.5 of Euclidean distance, perpendicular offset from straight line scaled by `tremor`

Sample N points along the curve where N = `ceil(MT * 60)` (60 events/sec at 60fps). Each point is jittered by Gaussian(σ = `tremor * pixelSize`) per axis, autocorrelated with τ ≈ 30ms.

Movement duration `MT = a + b * log2(D/W + 1)` (Fitts) where:
- `D` = Euclidean pixel distance
- `W` = target box minimum dimension
- `a = 200` ms (per-profile reaction time)
- `b = 90` ms/bit (per-profile motor speed)

Add a 5–15% chance of overshoot+correction past the target by `1.05–1.15 * D`, then a corrective sub-curve back to the actual target.

### 11.2 Keystroke timing

Per-letter press duration = Gaussian(80, 25) ms. Inter-key delay model:
- Same-hand digraphs: lognormal(μ=4.7, σ=0.35) ≈ 80–250ms
- Cross-hand digraphs: lognormal(μ=4.4, σ=0.30) ≈ 60–180ms
- After space: lognormal(μ=4.9, σ=0.40) ≈ 100–300ms
- After punctuation: 1.3× same-hand delay
- Mistakes: rate = `mistakeRate` (default 0.02). On mistake: type wrong key, delay 200–500ms, backspace, delay 100–300ms, type correct key.

### 11.3 Scroll model

Inertial scroll: initial velocity from a "flick" (target distance / 0.5s), friction-decayed exponentially with τ ≈ 350ms. Per-frame `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` of type `mouseWheel` with `deltaY` matching the curve, capped at 100px/frame (browsers throttle higher rates).

### 11.4 What we don't do in v1

- Real-trace recording/replay (v1.x)
- Per-profile mouse acceleration curves (v1.x)
- Touch gesture synthesis (v2 — mobile profiles)
- Eye-tracking-coupled mouse models (v2+)

## 12. Profile schema and capture protocol

### 12.1 `mochi capture`

```sh
$ mochi capture --profile-id mac-m2-chrome-stable --browser /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --out packages/profiles/data/mac-m2-chrome-stable
```

Steps:
1. Spawn the user-supplied browser (NOT through mochi launch — must capture *unmodified* baseline) with a clean user-data-dir.
2. Drive it to the local probe-page fixture.
3. Capture the Probe Manifest using a CDP attach.
4. Extract device-class facts (OS, browser version, GPU strings, audio sample rate, fonts list, etc.) into `profile.json`.
5. Capture audio fingerprint bytes for each known sampleRate-of-interest into `audio/*.bin`.
6. Capture canvas fingerprint maps for each known test payload into `canvas/*.json`.
7. Write `PROVENANCE.md` from interactive prompts (capturer, machine model, etc.).

### 12.2 Provenance discipline

Every profile in `main` was captured by a known person on a known machine on a known date. The PROVENANCE.md is verified at PR time by a maintainer; CI cannot verify provenance.

If a profile baseline degrades over time (Chrome ships new minor versions, fonts update, etc.), the profile is *re-captured* and bumped (e.g., `mac-m2-chrome-stable` v1.0.0 → v1.1.0). Old versions remain in the catalog with `deprecated: true` for one release window.

### 12.3 Profile compatibility

A `ProfileV1.browser.minVersion` and `maxVersion` declare which Chromium-for-Testing versions the profile is verified against. `mochi.launch` checks the binary version against this range and emits a warning if outside (errors only with `strict: true`).

## 13. Validation harness specification

### 13.1 Probe pages

| Page | Source | When |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/fixtures/probe-page.html` | local, vendored from chaser-recon's probes | every PR |
| creep.js | online | nightly |
| sannysoft | online | nightly |
| browserleaks/* | online | nightly |
| brotector | online | nightly |
| FingerprintJS demo | online | nightly |

### 13.2 Capture pipeline

```
mochi.launch → drive to probe page → wait for probes settled →
  CDP DOM scrape + Page.captureScreenshot + Network.getResponseBody for telemetry endpoints →
  build ProbeManifestV1 → write manifest.json
```

### 13.3 Diff pipeline

Mirror Peekaboo's `recon/equivalence/`:
- Normalize: strip GUIDs (visitor IDs, install IDs, MUID-class), CSP nonces, timestamps, bundle URLs, hostnames.
- Diff: structural deep-equality with path-based output.
- Categorize: each diff entry → guid-class | intentional | material.
- Report: HTML + JSON; gate on `material > 0`.

### 13.4 Per-profile expected divergences

`packages/profiles/data/<id>/expected-divergences.json` lists the *known* JS-only-uncoverable divergences for that profile (e.g., `["webrtc.localIp"]`). Anything in this list is categorized as `intentional`. Adding to this list requires a corresponding line in `docs/limits.md`.

### 13.5 PR-fast vs nightly

- **PR-fast (~10s):** runs `tests/fixtures/probe-page.html` for the *changed* profiles only (detected via path-based diff in CI).
- **Nightly (~10min):** runs all profiles against the full online suite. Failures open issues automatically.

### 13.6 The "Zero-Diff" definition

A profile is **Zero-Diff certified** when:
1. PR-fast harness against `tests/fixtures/probe-page.html` produces 0 material diffs.
2. Nightly harness against creepjs + sannysoft + browserleaks-canvas + browserleaks-webgl + browserleaks-fonts + brotector produces 0 material diffs (intentional + guid-class only).

The profile cannot be marked `production: true` in the catalog without Zero-Diff certification.

## 14. Implementation phases

Each phase is a meaningful milestone — works end-to-end at the level of the surface it covers. Phases gate on the harness running at the level it's been built up to.

| # | Phase | Deliverable | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0.0** | Foundation | Repo skeleton, Bun workspace, biome, tsconfig base, CI green on empty, contributor docs, PR template, conventional commits enforced. | CI passes on empty PRs |
| **0.1** | CDP transport | `@mochi.js/core` can launch Chromium-for-Testing via pipe FDs, send/receive CDP messages, navigate to a URL, dump the page HTML, close cleanly. **No spoofing yet.** | Unit tests on the transport; integration test that launches Chrome and reads `document.title` |
| **0.2** | Consistency engine v0 | `@mochi.js/consistency` implements ~30 of the 80 rules (navigator, screen, simple GPU strings). `MatrixV1` round-trips JSON cleanly. Schema validated. | CI: schema validation, rule DAG acyclicity, golden-file tests for matrix derivation |
| **0.3** | Inject engine v0 | `@mochi.js/inject` builds a payload that overrides the v0.2 surface. `@mochi.js/core` injects via `addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument(runImmediately:true)`. | Manual probe-page check shows spoofed values; no `Runtime.enable` ever sent |
| **0.4** | Capture tool | `mochi capture` works on a real Mac M2. `mac-m2-chrome-stable` profile + baseline manifest committed. | One real profile lives in repo, schema-valid, with PROVENANCE |
| **0.5** | Harness MVP | `@mochi.js/harness` runs against the local probe-page fixture, normalizes + diffs + categorizes + reports. PR gate wired in CI. | First "Zero-Diff" run on `mac-m2-chrome-stable` for the v0.2-covered surface |
| **0.6** | Network FFI (deprecated 0.7) | Initial `Session.fetch` shipped through Rust+wreq Bun:FFI. Replaced in 0.7 by Chromium-native CDP path; the `@mochi.js/net` and `@mochi.js/net-rs` packages are deprecated. | Historical — preserved for changelog continuity |
| **0.7** | Consistency engine full | All 80+ rules implemented. WebGL, WebGPU, canvas, audio, media-devices, speech-synthesis, fonts. Audio bytes + canvas hash maps in profiles. | Full Zero-Diff against local probe-page on `mac-m2-chrome-stable` |
| **0.8** | Behavioral engine | `@mochi.js/behavioral` synthesizes mouse/keyboard/scroll. `humanClick`, `humanType`, `humanScroll` work end-to-end. | Visual demo + a behavioral-tracker probe (chaser-recon's) sees human-shaped events |
| **0.9** | Profile catalog complete | All 6 v1 profiles captured + Zero-Diff against local fixture + nightly Zero-Diff against creepjs/sannysoft. | All 6 profiles certified |
| **0.10** | (deprecated 0.7) | Cross-platform `@mochi.js/net-rs` prebuilds were the original 0.10 deliverable. Removed when `Session.fetch` moved to Chromium-native in 0.7. | Historical — preserved for changelog continuity |
| **0.11** | CLI + DX | `mochi` CLI feature-complete: `browsers install`, `capture`, `harness`, `work`, `version`. Quickstart docs. | Quickstart doc takes a new user from `bun add @mochi.js/core` to a successful spoofed page in under 5 minutes |
| **0.12** | Examples | `examples/` directory with: basic-launch, login-flow, scrape-with-rotation, cloudflare-turnstile-page (read-only — we don't ship a solver), captcha-detection-not-bypass | All examples build + run as integration tests |
| **0.13** | Docs site | `docs/` site (mintlify or astro-starlight). API ref auto-generated from TS. Limits page complete. | Public-readable, navigable, accurate against current main |
| **1.0** | Public release | All packages green. All profiles Zero-Diff. Docs published. npm packages published. v1.0.0 tag. | The vision delivered |

Phases 0.0–0.5 are sequential. 0.6 + 0.7 can run in parallel after 0.5. 0.8 can start once 0.3 lands. 0.9–0.13 are extension layers that can run partly in parallel.

## 15. Open questions deferred to v2

These are real open questions that we're consciously NOT answering in v1. Each has a v2-tracking note in `docs/v2-deferrals.md` to revisit post-1.0.

1. **Cross-engine spoofing.** Spoofing Safari (JavaScriptCore) or Firefox (SpiderMonkey) from a Chromium binary. v1 same-engine-family is realistic; cross-engine has fundamental FPU/JIT/regex divergence that can't be hidden from a determined probe without a Chromium fork. v2: surface-level only, with documented caveats. v2.x: investigate WebAssembly-based JIT-spoofing for Math.fround / regex output.
2. **Mobile profiles.** Chrome-Android and Safari-iOS profiles. Touch event synthesis. Different default flag set. Different probe surface (sensors, orientation, vibration). v2.
3. **HTTP/3 / QUIC fingerprint.** Chromium emits H3 / QUIC natively when negotiated, but mochi has no separate "H3 mode" toggle on `Session.fetch`. Profiles may want to declare H3 expectations explicitly. v2.
4. **Captcha solvers.** Turnstile auto-click, hCaptcha solver, reCAPTCHA solver. Out of v1 scope on principle: solvers are a separate concern from a consistency framework, and bundling them blurs the value prop. Likely a separate `@mochi-extras/turnstile` package post-1.0.
5. **Real-trace recording for behavioral.** v1.x deliverable. The contract is reserved (`humanClick`'s `trace?` parameter) but the implementation is post-1.0.
6. **Remote debugging across machines.** Pipe-mode is local-only by definition. v2 may add an opt-in WebSocket transport for headless server scenarios; the leak surface needs careful design.
7. **Multi-session sharing of one Chromium process.** Currently one Session = one Chromium. If we want session pooling (open 100 sessions cheaply), we need to think hard about isolation across sessions in one process. v2.
8. **DevTools UI compatibility.** Right now mochi-driven sessions can't be inspected by chrome://inspect (pipe mode + no listening port). v2 may add an opt-in inspector-attach mode for development.
9. **Profile bisection.** When a Chrome update breaks a profile baseline, it would be nice to bisect which Chrome change. v2 tooling.

## 16. Glossary

- **Probe Manifest** — Peekaboo's canonical JSON schema describing a page's full capture surface. mochi vendors it.
- **Matrix** — a `ProfileV1` instantiated for a specific seed; the relationally-locked fingerprint snapshot consumed by the injector.
- **Profile** — a `ProfileV1` JSON document describing a device class. Lives in `@mochi.js/profiles/data/<id>/`.
- **Seed** — a string passed by the user to `mochi.launch`; determines per-session entropy within the profile's budget.
- **Zero-Diff** — the harness verdict where a captured manifest from a Mochi-driven session diffs against the baseline only on GUID-class fields.
- **Material diff** — a non-allowlisted, non-intentional divergence between Mochi-driven manifest and baseline. PR-blocking.
- **Intentional divergence** — a known-and-documented divergence (e.g., a probe we explicitly cannot replicate from JS-only). Listed in `expected-divergences.json`.
- **GUID-class** — per-session randomness (visitor IDs, install IDs, MUID-class IDs). Allowlisted.
- **Pipe mode** — `--remote-debugging-pipe`. CDP over file descriptors instead of TCP/WebSocket.
- **Worldname `""`** — the empty string as `worldName` parameter to `Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument`, meaning "main world." Critical because any non-empty value creates a detectable isolated world.
- **runImmediately** — boolean flag on `addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument`. When `true`, the script runs *before* any other page script in every new document. Mandatory for stealth.
- **Out-of-band fetch** — `Session.fetch`. HTTP request issued from Bun that routes through the running Chromium via CDP (`Network.loadNetworkResource` for simple GETs, `page.evaluate("fetch")` for non-GET). JA4/JA3/H2 are real Chrome by definition.
- **Funnel** — the implicit pattern where users hitting mochi's JS-only ceiling go find their own next step. mochi does not steer them.

*End of master plan. If you've made it this far, you have the full mental model. Now go ship.*
